Good For Day (GFD): The order will expire if not filled by the end of the trading day.

Good Till Canceled (GTC): This type of order can remain active for an extended period until the trader cancels it, or it gets filled. Some platforms may set a maximum duration for GTC orders (e.g., 90 days), after which they automatically expire if not executed.

Good Till Date (GTD): The trader specifies an expiration date and time for the order, after which it will expire if not filled.

Immediate or Cancel (IOC): The order must be executed immediately. Any portion that cannot be filled instantly is canceled.

Fill or Kill (FOK): Similar to IOC, but the order must be filled in its entirety immediately or else it is entirely canceled.
